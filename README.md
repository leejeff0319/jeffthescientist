## Introduction</span>
Hello, welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Jeff and I am currently working as a research scientist at Boston Children's Hospital. This project started when I was first getting into the field of Data Science, and I thought that it would be nice for me to learn to code a personal portfolio website for fun and to learn to code. I started brainstorming while I was outside, and drew a sketch of what I wanted it to look like as soon as I got home. This is what it looked like.</span>

There was also a lot of debugging to make components and libraries work with each other and optimization by refactoring, but they have all been left out. I would love to talk about the struggles and how I overcame each one, but I will leave it as it is for now! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions! </span>
